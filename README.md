This is a little study project that realises some basic mechanics from the Baba Is You game.
The game is not complete, the goal is just to make blocks move and interact without bugs.

Project uses:
- new unity input system;
- DOTween for blocks views moving
- couple 3D models from: https://kenney.nl/assets/prototype-kit
